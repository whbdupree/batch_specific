I needed to "vmap over a batch of Dense instances" in flax in order to support some batch-specific parameters. After some hacky workarounds, I found `flax.linen.vmap`. This simple example showcases an implementation of `flax.linen.vmap`. In "real life", you would probably process the input with an additional layer and feed the results of that layer into the batched Dense instances.
